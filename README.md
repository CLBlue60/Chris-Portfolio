# Chris' Portfolio

This is a simple HTML file for my portfolio. It includes sections for "About," "Work," and "Contact." Below is the structure and basic styling used in this HTML file:

## Structure
- **About Section**: Includes a brief introduction about Christopher Blue, his background, skills, and a profile image.
- **Work Section**: Displays a placeholder for showcasing work. Currently, it includes a link to a project and placeholder images.
- **Contact Section**: Provides contact information including email and phone number.

## Styling
- **Body**: Uses a fantasy font, sets margin and padding to 0, and has a background color of whitesmoke.
- **Header**: Styled with royal blue background, white text, and fixed position at the top.
- **Profile Image**: Rounded corners, shadow effect, and fixed size.
- **Navigation**: Inline layout with no list styling.
- **Sections**: Rounded corners, shadow effect, and specific font sizes.
- **Images**: Hover effect to scale up when hovered over.
